# PRODIGY_ML_01
I have implemented a linear regression dataset for house price prediction according to Task-01: "Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms."

Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

# Steps for Using the Dataset
1) Download all the four files from the website
2) Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3) Then open Google Collab
4) Add a Code cell above the given code to mount your Google drive.

# Code Execution:
The code is inside the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb file. Do the above steps and execute the code.
